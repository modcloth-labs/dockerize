# The deploy task is the one that will be called automatically when this
# application is deployed (assuming you use the unpack script).  Therefore,
# this should be your main task and should take care of calling any other tasks
# you need.  This Makefile is designed to be used to place files on the host
# machine that will be used by your container or to run your container.  Good
# examples include configuraiton files and Upstart conf files.
