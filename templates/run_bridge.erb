# tar-gzips your run directory and places it in a mounted directory.  This
# script is run within the container, meaning that the `run.tar.gz` file will
# be available from outside the container once the container has stopped.  In
# order to ensure this, the `/bridge` directory in the container must be
# mounted on the host system using the `-v` option to `docker run`.  An example
# can be found in the `dockerize-unpack` script mentioned in the README. That
# script is designed to be usable as-is.
